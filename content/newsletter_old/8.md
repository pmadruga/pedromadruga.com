# üóØ This week

- As I mentioned last week, I've been working on extracting stats from my jobs' feed at Upwork.com. The goal is to understand which are the most sought-out data science and data engineer skills. I'm building an ETL pipeline for this. If this is something that you'd be interested in - whether for Data Science or not - ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pmadruga_).

- The reason why math and programming go hand-in-hand:
