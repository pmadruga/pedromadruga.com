Hi!

This newsletter is a way to get the content I write on [my blog](/blog) delivered to your inbox. Alternatively, you can subscribe to my [RSS feed](/blog/index.xml).

Iâ€™ll write about industry-applied Artificial Intelligence, which is [my main expertise](/about). Specifically, about Information Retrieval using Generative AI, but not exclusively. Iâ€™m a big fan of AI-based product development, so you can expect a mix of research and anecdotal writings. I'll also experiment with open-source LLMs, hack with my Raspberry Pis and Neovim, and more.

I'm writing this at the very beginning of this newsletter, but hopefully, you can help me with accountability to keep writing. :)

Opinions are and will always be my own.
