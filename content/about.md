Hey there, I'm Pedro.

I'm the Lead AI Scientist at [Karnov Group](https://karnovgroup.com) - a 150-year-old European-wide company that provides information solutions in the areas of legal, tax, and auditing. I have been leading a (growing) team of AI scientists in the North Region.

Starting in 2023, I have created, developed, and led an AI-powered legal research assistant that has been featured in several Danish newspapers ([Berlingske](https://www.berlingske.dk/virksomheder/kunstig-intelligens-er-for-alvor-rykket-ind-paa-advokatkontoret-vi-er), [BÃ¸rsen](https://borsen.dk/nyheder/tech/dansk-virksomhed-fra-1867-gar-i-offensiven-med-ai)), and is used by top law firms in Denmark as well as the supreme courts in Sweden.

I started my Data Science career in 2018 and have worked with Artificial Intelligence in the legal, financial, and philanthropic sectors. I have worked mostly with Natural Language Processing but also with time series challenges. Since 2022, I've worked with Generative AI in the legal domain.

From 2012 to 2018, I worked as a Software Engineer in Copenhagen, Denmark. I have contributed to React Native with a [library](https://github.com/pmadruga/react-native-clean-project) with 1000+ stars on Github, and have won 3rd place in React Europe's hackathon 2018 edition.

I have briefly worked as a Data Analyst and have work featured on [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-worlds-20-most-bike-friendly-cities-2013-4).

I have an engineering background. I studied Computer Engineering in the early 2000s, followed by a Master's Degree in Environmental Engineering (with specialization in Environmental Impacts). I have a Machine Learning course from [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/continuing-education/courses/digital-competency-courses/machine-learning) - including a [final project](posts/machine-learning-heart-rate/).

I love spending time with my family, running, and reading books. I have ran a couple of marathons and one ultra-marathon. Here's me ~running~ walking in the ultra-marathon (2023):
