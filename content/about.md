I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I have 10+ years of Software Engineering experience and 4+ years of consulting experience, a background in Engineering (MSc), and a course in Machine Learning at DTU, which provided me with the experience and expertise, statistical and mathematical foundations to tackle different challenges.  

My profile has its foundation in three pillars:

1. Communication and collaboration:

Data Science is a field that needs input from different stakeholders, and collaboration (alongside expertise) is the means to achieve business value. My profile is a business-oriented Data Scientist: I value real-world, hands-on experience and prioritize understanding stakeholders' needs - regardless of being management, engineers, marketers, etc.  

2. From idea to production:

Via my software engineering skills and experience, I bring a unique capacity for delivering data science products, from its model conception/architecture to production.

I prioritize building prototypes and perform small iterations to validate ideas quickly. I'm constantly finding new ways to determine how can Data Science/AI generate business value.

3. Passion and creativity-driven:

I have a background in Engineering (MSc) and a course in Machine Learning, which provided me with the statistical and mathematical foundations to tackle different challenges.

As a technical writer about data science/machine learning/data engineering but also a podcast host, open-source maintainer, and homemade cluster computer builder, my community involvement expresses the passion I place in every project I embrace.

What motivates me as a Data Scientist is the ability to use all my knowledge gathered over the years while being able to solve different challenges throughout the process, while being surrounded by exceptional and motivated people.
