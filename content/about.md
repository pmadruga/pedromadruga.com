I'm a Data Scientist and Software Engineer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Through my software engineering skills and experience, I bring a unique capacity for delivering data science products, from its model conception/architecture to production. I believe there's no incorrect data, only improper questions to that data.

Having created different companies and lead teams over the years allows me to bring high-quality communication skills to the table and a will to handle and tackle risk head-on. I've also profoundly embraced pragmatism and excellent product quality.

My background in Environmental Engineering (UNL, Portugal) and a course in Machine Learning (DTU, Denmark) allowed having a solid foundation for tackling all the challenges above. As a tech writer, podcast host, community maintainer, and homemade cluster computer builder, my community involvement is an expression of the passion I place in every project I embrace.
