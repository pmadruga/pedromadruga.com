# 🗯 This week

- I've been wrapping up the series on "[Building an ETL pipeline from scratch](https://pedromadruga.com/posts/etl-pipeline/)." It's a great opportunity to get started if you're not used to building pipelines. The bonus is that it uses the newest version of Airflow. I hope to finish the blog post in a week or two.
- After a week of posting tweets on stats regarding successful data science projects, I figured the best is to compile in a (future) blogpost. After seeing so many failed projects, I found it interesting to understand how to tackle common data science problems. If you're curious, I started tweting about it around [here](https://twitter.com/pmadruga_/status/1450415183340441600). Here are some example stats: ![stats](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCDolGdXMAQbRVI?format=jpg&name=medium)
