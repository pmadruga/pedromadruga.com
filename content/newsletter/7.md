# üóØ Quick update

- Last month, O'Reilly released the 2021 Data/AI Salary Survey. It's a good insight into the most well-paid programming languages, tools, cloud providers, etc. Download it [here](https://get.oreilly.com/rs/107-FMS-070/images/2021-Data-AI-Salary-Survey.pdf).

- To understand the Data Science/Data Engineering freelance market, I've been extracting data from [Upwork](https://upwork.com), a website for people finding freelancers and for freelancers to find tasks. The goal is to understand a few things, such as the most sought-out skills, the highest/lowest paying jobs.
