# 5 Minutes of Data Science - week 2
Highlights from January 09 to January 15

## **Foreword**
Hi everyone!

It seems that github links and reddit links are the most clicked of this newsletter, so I decided to move those to the top, for quick access.

If you have any feedback and feeds that you'd like included, ping me on [Mastodon](https://sigmoid.social/@pmadruga). See you next week!
