# 5 Minutes of Data Science - week 3
Highlights from January 16 to January 22

## **Foreword**

There are a couple of big news from last week. Firstly, Google launched a free [Deep Learning Tuning Book](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook/blob/main/README.md) and [HOWTO build GPT2 from scratch](https://twitter.com/pmadruga_/status/1615398117683388417). 

Come say hi on [Mastodon](https://sigmoid.social/@pmadruga). See you next week!
