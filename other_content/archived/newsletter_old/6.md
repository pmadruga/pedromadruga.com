# üóØ Week retrospective

The pace of the blog posts has slowed a bit, but not the newsletter, so here's a new newsletter item. It has to do with the volume of work I'm luckily facing. I've also created [an account](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/pmadruga) on Upwork to keep broadening my data science and data engineering skills by doing actual client work. When you're new to the platform, you face some challenges, and that's something I'll write about later.

Until then, here's what's going on out there.
