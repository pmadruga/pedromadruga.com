    <p>
        A Software Engineer shifting towards Machine Learning and AI via Data Science. </p>

        <p> I've been working several years as a Software Engineer to build multiple applications, web and mobile, as well as a frontender and a backender, as a team leader, a <a target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” href="https://occam.ooo">company creator</a> and community organizer, but also as a consultant and full time employee, helping and enabling companies deliver high-quality products.</p>
        
        <p> With a background in Engineering, and after having completed a <a target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” href="https://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/Continuing-education/Courses/Computer-Science/Machine-Learning">Machine Learning course</a> in Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and worked as a Data Scientist trainee, I'm now shifting towards Data Science.</p>
        
        <p>
        I'm also a <a target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Native-CPH/">development community maintainer</a>, a <a target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” href="http://scopecreeperspodcast.com">podcast host</a>, a <a target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” href="/tag/development/">tech writer</a>, a <a target=”_blank” rel=”noopener noreferrer” href="https://www.foreningen-nydansker.dk/">volunteer</a> and an absolute fan of creating things by code and empathy.
