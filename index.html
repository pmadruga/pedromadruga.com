  <div class="about">

    <p>I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I bring a unique capacity of delivering products, from its model conception/architecture to production. I believe there's no incorrect data, only improper questions to that data.</p>

    <p>Having created different companies and lead teams over the years, allows me to bring high-quality communication skills to the table and a will to handle and tackle risk head on. Through my software engineering skills and experience, I've deeply embraced pragmatism and excellent product quality. </p>
      
      <p>My background in Environmental Engineering (UNL, Portugal) and a course in Machine Learning (DTU, Denmark) allowed having a solid foundation for tackling all the challenges above. My community involvement as a tech writer, podcast host, community maintainer, home-made cluster computer builder is an expression of the passion I place in every project I embrace.</p>

    <p>But above all, a father.</p>
